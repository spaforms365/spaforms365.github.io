## What is SPA-FORMS-365, exactly ?

SPA-FORMS-365 is SharePoint Add-in. It converts out-of-box Forms on SharePoint list into Single Page Application (SPA) executed on client side, in a web browser. SPA is a key enabling environment to design a full-fledged application, containing custom workflows, various visual forms and data-storade device on top of a list item.  

## How to use SPA Forms ?

With SPA-FORMS-365 you can construct the form for SharePoint list in a web browser, similar to user experience provided by SharePoint out-of-box. SPA Forms transparently builds project with SPA implementation source code for the new form on your behalf. Then automatically scaffolded and provisioned SPA implementation can be directly published to use with the list at production.
