## So what is SPA-FORMS-365, exactly?

SPA-FORMS-365 is SharePoint Add-in. It converts out-of-box SharePoint list's form into Single Page Application (SPA) executed on client side, in a web browser.

With SPA-FORMS-365 you can construct the form for SharePoint list in a web browser, similar to user experience provided by SharePoint out-of-box. SPA-FORMS-365 transparently constructs SPA implementation for the new form on your behalf. Then automatically scaffolded and provisioned SPA implementation can be directly published to use with the list at production.     

 is an alternative UI for It takes a template
directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/))
and our [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, and
spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable
for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll
to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers **for
free**.
