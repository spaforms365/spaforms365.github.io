~SPA Forms 365 app must be added on SharePoint site before use with lists.

## Provision and configure SharePoint List

  <h5>Note regarding SharePoint lists hosted on Office 365</h5>
  <p>
    SPA Forms 365 UI requires ribbon feature enabled on SharePoint List. In the meantime ribbon is not available by default on newly provisioned lists at Office 365. You must explicitly enable ribbon on list with SPA Forms 365.

    Open <code>Settings</code> page on your list and select <code>Advanced Settings</code> section. Scroll to the bottom of page and switch your list into <code>Classic experience</code>.
