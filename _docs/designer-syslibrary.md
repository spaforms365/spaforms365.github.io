### Custom Components
Sometimes you may need either sligtly customize existing <code>system library component</code> or build your own new component from scratch. 
<br/>
<br/>
Source codes for all system library components are open-source & available, but for runtime components packaged into <code>read-only</code> optimized and minified module <code>syscomponents.min.js</code>. And it is always harder to build anything from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
The <code>Designer</code> can assist with effortless creation of fully functioning <code>prototype</code> for that new custom component. So user can start from that and develop custom functionality.
