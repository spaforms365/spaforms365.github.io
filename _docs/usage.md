Custom SPA Form project must be designed first and then published into runtime (production) model for end users.
<br/> 
<br/>
<code>Design</code> and <code>Runtime</code> environments are <code>fully isolated</code> from each other. User can safely modify and debug SPA Form project design with no risk to affect current in use runtime version on SPA form.
<br/> 
<br/>
When changes with design are completed, SPA Form project can be <code>published</code> to update runtime model for end users. 

### Runtime model usage:
At runtime (or production) time, SPA Form shows up instead of out-of-box forms. User can continue use any standard out-of-box UI controls (like context menus or ribbon buttons) relevant to SharePoint List Item.
